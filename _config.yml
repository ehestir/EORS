title: Earth Observation & Remote Sensing Lab
decsription: Our lab studies the impacts of climate change, land use, and water management on all Earth ecosystems with a particular focus on aquatic systems. We use a combination of satellite and airborne imagery, field observations, and laboratory experiments. Study sites range from arctic to tidal wetlands and coral reefs. Our research spans the biological, physical, and meteorological aspects of these systems. Our lab is lead by Dr. Erin Hestir, Assistant Professor in Geospatial Analytics and Remote Sensing in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering here at UC Merced.
